This repository is using transformers from HuggingFace to solve an interesting task: To get a summary about a topic from Wikipedia.
Techniques used in this repo are:

- Data scraping with BeautifulSoup
- Summarizing transformer
- Question-Answering transformer
- Comperhension transformer

It was a fun school project to see how few components could be used to create value for an end-user.
Even though no training of models were done (see other repos for that), you can easily see the power of Transformers here.
This project was more of a study of scraping and utilizing AI in a minimal way.
